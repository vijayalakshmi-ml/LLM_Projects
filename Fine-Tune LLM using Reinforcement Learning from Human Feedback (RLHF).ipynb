    "**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is one type of machine learning where agents take actions in an environment aimed at maximizing their cumulative rewards. The agent's behavior is defined by the **policy**. And the goal of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn an optimal, or nearly-optimal, policy that maximizes the **reward function**. \n",

Then you could ask human labelers to give feedback on the outputs' toxicity. However, it can be expensive to use them for the entire fine-tuning process. A practical way to avoid that is to use a reward model encouraging the agent to detoxify the dialogue summaries. The intuitive approach would be to do some form of sentiment analysis across two classes (`nothate` and `hate`) and give a higher reward if there is higher a chance of getting class `nothate` as an output. \n",

Then, the model will be fine-tuned with PPO using those reward values.\n",
